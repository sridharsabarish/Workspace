# Developer Log

## 04.10.2025
* Trying to install Home assistant in a VM


## 30.09.2025
* Finished off pending tasks in JIRA
* Create a dummy issue in github
* Brainstormed a bit for smart home and smart mirror.



## 23.09.2025
* Realised RPI charger change doesn't bring the display back. Perhaps good to try HDMI
* Even HDMI doesn't work. Needs more creative solutions.


## 20.09.2025
* Investigated why latest smart mirror code was not working on RPI.
* Found that it has to do with loguru import, so commneted it our and tried running, it worked
* Next, began investigating why RPI won't turn on, Low voltage seems to be a problem. This could be solved by a purchase of official RPI charger.
