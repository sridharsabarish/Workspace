## 23.09.2025
* Realised RPI charger change doesn't bring the display back. Perhaps good to try HDMI
* Even HDMI doesn't work. Needs more creative solutions.


## 20.09.2025
* Investigated why latest smart mirror code was not working on RPI.
* Found that it has to do with loguru import, so commneted it our and tried running, it worked
* Next, began investigating why RPI won't turn on, Low voltage seems to be a problem. This could be solved by a purchase of official RPI charger.
